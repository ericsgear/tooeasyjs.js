tooeasyjs.js  1/28/2017 v0.1

This "library" of helper functions was designed to help out various levels of programmers do different things.  Some helper funtions do math and geometry, some are alias functions for built-in JavaScript functionality, and some are there to simply make programming easier for super beginners.

For instance, instead of doing: if (varA < varB) you can do: if (isLessThan(varA, varB)) to make it more like English.  This won't help you in the long run, but it'll hopefully get people past the "Nooo, programming is scary/super hard!" idea.

This is not an exhaustive set of helper functions, so if you have something that is useful, add it and if it seems like it's good code and useful, I'll keep it.

We don't charge for this "library", and we know it's going to be "stolen" for various projects, so just use it. Heck, it's on GitHub...

If you feel the need or desire, please feel free to give Eric's Gear credit for this file and a link to the source, but that's more so other people see it (and can decide to use it) than anything else.

If you *really* feel the need or desire, you can donate some money to us...

Thank you for using/looking at this library and I hope you find it useful!
